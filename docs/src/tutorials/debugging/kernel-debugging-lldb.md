# Debugging a Kernel with LLDB

This tutorial walks through a complete LLDB debugging session against a kernel running in QEMU. 
The goal is to verify, and not to assume, that the boot process worked, meaning that the Multiboot2 magic is correct, the info pointer is valid, and the CPU is executing our C code. 
The same workflow applies any time you need to inspect registers, step through assembly, or verify memory layout.

## Prerequisites

LLDB and QEMU must be installed (see [Dependencies](../../project/setup/dependencies.md)). 
Familiarity with the Multiboot2 entry state helps — see [Multiboot2](../../wiki/boot/multiboot2.md). 
For a quick command reference, see [LLDB](../../project/tooling/lldb.md).

## The Setup

QEMU has a built-in GDB stub. When we start QEMU with `-s -S`, it:

- Opens a debug port on `localhost:1234` (`-s`)
- Pauses the CPU at the first instruction (`-S`)

LLDB connects to this port and gains full control: breakpoints, single-stepping, register and memory inspection.

```
┌──────────────┐        TCP :1234        ┌────────────────┐
│  Terminal 1   │ ◄────────────────────► │     QEMU       │
│  (LLDB)       │   GDB Remote Protocol  │  (CPU paused)  │
└──────────────┘                         └────────────────┘
```

## Starting the Debug Session

**Terminal 1** — launch QEMU in debug mode:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom build/janus.iso -boot d -serial stdio -s -S
```

QEMU opens but the virtual CPU is frozen. No code executes until the debugger says so.

**Terminal 2** — connect LLDB:

```bash
lldb build/kernel.elf
```

At the `(lldb)` prompt:

```
(lldb) gdb-remote localhost:1234
```

LLDB loads our kernel's symbol table and attaches to QEMU's virtual CPU. At this point the instruction pointer is at the BIOS reset vector (`0xFFF0`), before any of our code has run.

## Setting a Breakpoint

Tell LLDB to pause when execution reaches `kernel_main`:

```
(lldb) b kernel_main
Breakpoint 1: where = kernel.elf`kernel_main + 15 at main.c:42
```

Now let the kernel boot. GRUB will load the kernel, jump to `_start`, the boot assembly switches to long mode, and eventually calls `kernel_main` — where the breakpoint fires:

```
(lldb) c
Process 1 resuming
Process 1 stopped
* thread #1, stop reason = breakpoint 1.1
    frame #0: kernel.elf`kernel_main(magic=920085129, info=0x00000000001010e0) at main.c:42:15
```

## Inspecting Boot State

### Verifying the Multiboot2 Magic

The first argument to `kernel_main` is the magic number. Check it:

```
(lldb) p/x magic
(uint32_t) $0 = 0x36d76289
```

`0x36D76289` is the Multiboot2 bootloader magic — GRUB passed the correct value. If this were wrong, the bootloader either did not use Multiboot2 or the ABI convention was violated.

### Verifying the Info Pointer

```
(lldb) p/x info
(void *) $1 = 0x00000000001010e0
```

A non-null address in the low megabytes is expected. This points to the Multiboot2 information structure that GRUB populated with memory maps, ELF section headers, and similar metadata.

### Register Dump

For a full view of the CPU state:

```
(lldb) register read
general:
       rax = 0x0000000080000000
       rbx = 0x00000000001010c0
       rdi = 0x0000000036d76289      ← magic (1st argument)
       rsi = 0x00000000001010e0      ← info  (2nd argument)
       rbp = 0x0000000000106ff0      ← frame pointer (on stack)
       rsp = 0x0000000000106fe0      ← stack pointer
       rip = 0x000000000010109f      ← instruction pointer
```

`rdi` and `rsi` confirm the System V AMD64 calling convention: the first two integer/pointer arguments arrive in these registers.

## Stepping Through Code

Step to the next source line with `n` (step over) — this executes the `if (magic != ...)` check:

```
(lldb) n
    frame #0: kernel.elf`kernel_main at main.c:51:15
-> 51       if (info == NULL) {
```

The magic check passed. Step again:

```
(lldb) n
    frame #0: kernel.elf`kernel_main at main.c:60:12
-> 60       for (;;) {
```

The null check passed too. The kernel is now sitting in the infinite halt loop — exactly as designed.

## Useful Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `gdb-remote localhost:1234` | Attach to QEMU |
| `b kernel_main` | Break at function entry |
| `b main.c:42` | Break at a specific line |
| `c` | Continue until next breakpoint |
| `n` | Step over (next source line) |
| `s` | Step into (enter function calls) |
| `stepi` | Execute one machine instruction |
| `p/x $rdi` | Print register in hex |
| `frame variable` | Show local variables |
| `register read` | Dump all general-purpose registers |
| `bt` | Backtrace (show call stack) |
| `memory read 0xB8000 -c 16` | Read 16 bytes of memory |

## Troubleshooting

**LLDB says "Failed to connect"** — QEMU must be running with `-s -S`. Verify the process is alive and port 1234 is open (`ss -tlnp | grep 1234`).

**"Unable to resolve breakpoint"** — the kernel was likely built without debug symbols. Verify with `file build/kernel.elf` — the output should mention "not stripped" and "with debug_info". Ensure `-g` is in the compiler flags.

**Breakpoint fires at an unexpected address** — if the kernel uses higher-half mappings, LLDB may resolve the symbol to a virtual address that does not match the physical address where the code actually executes early in boot. Use `b -a 0x10109f` (or whatever `readelf -s` reports) to set a breakpoint at a physical address directly.
